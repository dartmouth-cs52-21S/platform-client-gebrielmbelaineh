# SA2: Starter Pack

*Frontend Starter Pack*

[deployed url](https://happy-engelbart-9c91c0.netlify.app/)

## What Worked Well

webpack dev server starts and serves pages</br>
babel is configured</br>
eslint is configured - it complains if there is bad code / autocorrects indents etc</br>
webpage displays and counts seconds</br>
image displays and is loaded via webpack </br>
js is es6 and linted without errors! </br>



## What Didn't

Everything worked out smoothly.

## Extra Credit

I added the image-optimize-loader.
