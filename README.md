# Platform Client 

*React+Redux Content Platform*

[deployed url](https://youthful-dijkstra-cc6bfe.netlify.app/)

## What Worked Well
I really enjoyed working with redux. Setting it up took some time, but it was definetly worth it.<br>
It made handling the states within the different components so much easier.<br>
Route to new, list and full show view <br>
Create a new post <br>
Fetch all posts <br>
Fetch a single post<br>
Update a post <br>
Delete a post <br>
Styled reasonably <br>

## What Didn't
Update works but I can't seem to populate the input fields of 
title, tag, coverUrl, and content going from list to full show view <br>

## Extra Credit
Nothing unfortunately ☹️
